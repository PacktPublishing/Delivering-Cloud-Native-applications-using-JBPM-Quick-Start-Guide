The project lab01-hello-jbpm 
======

The project, in the early stage of the development phase, simulates an intelligent customer service that collects feedback and doubts about jBPM. It uses rules and processes capabilities.

The use case covers the automatic resolution based on intelligent decisions to solve issues from customers. It also should know when to address more complex ones to the Customer Service. The Customer Service has a group who is responsible for visualizing the customer issue and providing answers to the customer. Finally, the customer can visualize the answer (which is automatic or answered by Customer Service) and rate the quality of the result.
